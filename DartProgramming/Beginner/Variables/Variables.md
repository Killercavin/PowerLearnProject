# Variables & Data Types in Dart

## Variables

Variables are containers or storages/ memory locations used to hold data in programming languages ie Dart

### Variable declaration in Dart

#### Using ***var*** keyword
Used to declare variables with known types during compilation time

```dart
void main(){
    var greeting = 'Hello';
}
```

#### Using ***data type*** keyword
Used to declare variables just similar to var but instead of using var variableName we use dataType variableName

```dart
String name = 'Dart';
int age = 25;
bool isTrue = true;
double pi = 3.142;
```

#### Using ***dynamic*** keyword
Used to declare variables that the type is not known during runtime

```dart
dynamic pi = 3.142;
```
