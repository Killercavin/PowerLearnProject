void main() {
  var a = 1;
  var maxnum = 11;
  while (a < maxnum) {
    // it will print until the expression return false
    print(a);
    a = a + 1; // increase value 1 after each iteration
  }
}
//The code prints numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop in Dart. The while loop will execute until the condition a < maxnum is false. The value of a is incremented by 1 after each iteration. The output of the code is: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
