void main() {
  var a = 1;
  var maxnum = 10;
  do {
    print("The value is: ${a}");
    a = a + 1; // adding 1 to variable a after every sequence
  } while (a < maxnum);
}
//The code iteratively prints the value of variable a until it reaches 10, using a do-while loop in Dart.

// The do-while loop is used when we want to execute a block of code at least once, and then repeat it as long as a condition is true. The block of code is executed first, and then the condition is checked. If the condition is true, the block of code is executed again. The loop continues until the condition is false. The syntax of the do-while loop is as follows:

// do {
//   // block of code
// } while (condition);
// The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but the key difference is that the block of code is executed at least once, even if the condition is false. The condition is checked after the block of code is executed. If the condition is true, the block of code is executed again. If the condition is false, the loop is terminated. The do-while loop is useful when we want to execute a block of code at least once, regardless of the condition.
